## Tried and abandoned for N5

- Anki
- Satori Reader
- Duolingo (I completed the original Japanese course before the big UI update)
- Shin Nihongo 500 Mon - this would be more useful for N4 imo. 
- A Guide to Japanese Grammar by Tae Kim - it would be more useful for higher levels - too in-depth for N5.
